# Virtual_Mouse
A Virtual Mouse program which I made with Mediapipe and open-cv. 
At first this program detects your hand 
Then if your index finger and thumb touvh eachother it is going to give your hand's coordiantions to the mouse cursor and fnally mocing it to the psitions.
The whole concept of moving, Clicking, Double clicking and draging moves around the different fingers touching thumb.
It works for both left and right hand.

There are some ugs and issues as the program is still in development but it will be fixed!
This project is just a single and smaller part of my project IVA (Intelligent Virtual Assistant).
